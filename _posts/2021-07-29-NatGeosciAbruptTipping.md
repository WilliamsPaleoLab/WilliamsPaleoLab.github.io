A new paper out in Nature Geoscience [*Past abrupt changes, tipping points and cascading impacts in the Earth system*](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41561-021-00790-5) reviews evidence of past abrupt changes in the Earth System, their causes, and their propagation from one part of the Earth System (e.g. the North Atlantic) to other regions.  Jack Williams was part of the lead writing team for this paper, with Victor Brovkin the lead author.
