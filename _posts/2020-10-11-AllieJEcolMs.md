Allie Jensen's paper [*More than one way to kill a spruce forest: The role of fire and climate in the late‚Äêglacial termination of spruce woodlands across the southern Great Lakes*](https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1365-2745.13517) is now published in early access format in the Journal of Ecology.  This work tests hypotheses about the role of rising temperatures and altered fire regimes as drivers of the widespread loss of spruce forests and woodlands across the central and eastern US at the end of the last glacial period.  This widespread loss of a major vegetation type is a potential analog for the possible loss of coniferous forests in the western US today with continued warming.  Great job Allie!
