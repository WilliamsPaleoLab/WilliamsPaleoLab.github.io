Congratulations to Dr. Nora Schlenker for the successful defense of her PhD dissertation *Vegetation dynamics in a novel and rapidly changing world - using a biogeographical and palaeoecological lens.*  Nora passed her defense with flying colors, using data and concepts from the past to better understand how species will respond to current and future climate changes.

Nora is off to Aarhus University in Denmark for a postdoc, leaving in July, so it's exciting to see her move to the next stage of her career and scholarship.  Congratulations Nora!
