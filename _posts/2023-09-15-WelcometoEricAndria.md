Welcome to Eric and Andria!  Eric Giese is an incoming MSc student who is working on understanding the post-glacial geomorphic and ecological history in eastern Wisconsin.  Eric joins us from UW-Oshkosh and is currently working up new sediment cores collected from Long Lake, WI. Dr. Andria Dawson is a faculty member on sabbatical leave from Mount Royal University, and is a quantitative ecologist interested in reconstructions of past land cover and biophysical parameters, as a way of better understanding past vegetation-atmosphere feedbacks.  Andria is here to advance a couple of papers, reconnect with colleagues (she's a former postdoc), and enjoy Wisconsin in the fall.
