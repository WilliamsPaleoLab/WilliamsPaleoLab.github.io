We're delighted to announce that two new awards from the National Science Foundation will support the continued growth of the Neotoma Paleoecology Database and its supported data types, software services, and community of researchers.  One award, from the NSF Geoinformatics program, will provide backbone support for Neotoma and enable development of new services, such as better linkages to research ORCID profiles, tools to visualize and explore the taxonomic hierarchies stored in Neotoma, and tools to protect sensitive data submitted to Neotoma.  A second award, from the NSF Infrastructure Capacity for Biological Research Program, is supporting the expansion of Neotoma to support ancient environmental DNA, a fast-growing area of paleoecological research that is shedding new light into the patterns and drivers of past biodiversity dynamics and community assembly.
