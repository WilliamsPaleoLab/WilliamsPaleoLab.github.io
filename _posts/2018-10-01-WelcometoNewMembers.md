Several new people are joining the Williams Lab in Fall 2018. **Angie Perrotti** is a postdoc working on the late-glacial vegetation-climate-megafauna project (NSF-PCE), and as a recent grad of Texas A&M brings deep expertise in anthropology, palynology, and coprophilous spore signals of megafaunal population declines.  **Adrian George**, recent graduate from Smith College, is joining to work on building new data visualizations from Neotoma Explorer.  They are interested in global change, biodiversity, and the signals in long ecological time series.  **Feiya Lv** is a PhD student from Lanzhou University visiting on a fellowship from China.  Welcome to all!
