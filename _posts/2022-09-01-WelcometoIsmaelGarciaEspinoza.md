Welcome to Ismael Garcia Espinoza!  Ismael is a Fulbright Scholar, who has just arrived from Colombia to pursue his PhD studies in the US. Ismael has a Masters in Geography and an undergraduate degree in Geology, and he is interested in studying climate-driven ecological dynamics.  He's already started ice skating lessons, so he'll be ready for the Wisconsin winters soon!
