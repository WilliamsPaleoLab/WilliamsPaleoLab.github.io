 [*Global acceleration in rates of vegetation change over the past 18,000 years*](https://science.sciencemag.org/content/372/6544/860.full) is now published in Science.  This paper was led by Ondrej Mottl and Suzette Flantua of the HOPE team at Bergen and with senior authors Alistair Seddon (HOPE) and Jack Williams (UW-Madison).  This paper draws upon fossil pollen records from the [Neotoma Paleoecology Database](https://www.neotomadb.org/) to demonstrate that rates of vegetation change globally are now as fast or faster as those accompanying the end of the last ice age.  This is remarkable, given the widespread transformations in global ecosystems associated with the end of the last ice age.  The recent changes, which began 3 to 4 thousand years ago, likely are due at least in part to human activity, but more work is needed to better attribute the causes of past vegetation change.  Lots of good media write-ups about this story, including pieces in [National Geographic](https://www.nationalgeographic.com/environment/article/humans-have-stressed-out-earth-far-longer-and-more-dramatically-than-realized), [Science](https://science.sciencemag.org/content/372/6544/786), [Nature](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-01336-w), [Wisconsin State Journal](https://madison.com/wsj/news/local/environment/study-humans-have-been-changing-the-planet-for-longer-than-we-thought/article_21ef3a47-b6bf-5c64-939f-f01cfa33e8fd.html#tracking-source=home-top-story-1), and [NSF](https://www.nsf.gov/discoveries/disc_summ.jsp?cntn_id=302872&org=NSF&from=news).  A nice showcase too of the power of large, open, community-curated data resources such as Neotoma.
