Angie Perrotti's paper [*Diverse responses of vegetation and fire after pleistocene megaherbivore extinction across the eastern US*](https://authors.elsevier.com/a/1fnke-4PS2FrA) is now published in Quaternary Science Reviews. Alongside collaborators, Angie tested the hypothesis that end-Pleistocene megaherbivore extinction caused a cascade of changes including an incursion of woody vegetation, no-analog vegetation assemblages, and fire activity increase in eastern North America. Using the largest-to-date network of dung fungal spores, pollen, and macrocharcoal proxy records, this research found that ecosystems in the northern US are more sensitive to megaherbivory than those in the southeastern US.
