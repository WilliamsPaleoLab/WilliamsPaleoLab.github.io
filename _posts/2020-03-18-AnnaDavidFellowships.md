Congratulations to Anna and David for their campus awards!  Anna has received a [2020 STEM Public Service Fellowship]( https://wiscience.wisc.edu/program/public-service-fellows), while David has received a [L&S Teaching Fellow Award](https://ls.wisc.edu/current-students/graduate-students/ta-resources/fellows).  These are both highly competitive awards, and each testifies to Anna’s and David’s commitment to translating knowledge from the research domain to the public sphere.
