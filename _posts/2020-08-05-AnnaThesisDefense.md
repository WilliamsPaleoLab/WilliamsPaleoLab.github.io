Congratulations to Anna George for the successful defense of her MSc Thesis *Ice Age Mapping as a Case Study: Interactive Cartography and Big Open Data in Paleoecology*!  As the title suggests, Anna has been working at the intersection of Cartography and Paleoecology, developing and testing a new generation of interactive maps of past species distributions.  For a sneak preview of her work, see [http://open.neotomadb.org/CartoAnimations/legend.html](Range Mapper).
