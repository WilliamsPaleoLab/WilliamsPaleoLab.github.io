blurb: "Simon Goring, Kevin Braun, and Jack Williams are off to the Northwoods for a week of integrated instruction in paleoecology, Bayesian statistics, and ecosystem modeling at the UNDERC field station, near Land O Lakes, WI. The one-week short course provides 15 graduate students with a crash course in the fundamentals of paleoecological data and informatics, R, and the statistical tools for data-model assimilation. This work is part of the Paleoecological Observatory Network (PalEON) and is supported by NSF-Macrosystems. Some course materials can be viewed [here](https://paleon.geography.wisc.edu/doku.php/courses_and_camp%3Bcamp2014%3Bstart). Thanks, NSF!"
