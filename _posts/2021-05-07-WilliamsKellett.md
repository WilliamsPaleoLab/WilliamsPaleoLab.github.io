Jack just received UW-Madison's Kellett Mid-Career Award [https://news.wisc.edu/faculty-receive-warf-named-professorships-kellett-fellowships-and-romnes-awards/](news release), given out in recognition of their research accomplishments.  This is very much a recognition of the accomplishments of everyone in the lab and colleagues in the Neotoma Paleoecology Database, PalEON, and elsewhere. Congrats, Jack, and congrats all!
