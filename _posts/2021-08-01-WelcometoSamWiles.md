Welcome to Sam Wiles!  Sam is an incoming MSc student, recently from Williams & Mary.  Sam will be working on a project examining the rapid collapses of beech (*Fagus grandifolia*) and hemlock (*Tsuga canadensis*) in the Great Lakes region over the last 6,000 years.  Sam is working with Nora Schlenker on this and colleagues at the University of Wyoming and University of Maryland.
