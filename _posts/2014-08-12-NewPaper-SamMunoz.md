blurb: "A new paper is [in press](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jbi.12386/abstract) by Sam Munoz and others in the Journal of Biogeography. Sam's recent synthesis of historical, archaeological, and palaeoecological data argues that prehistoric human impacts in eastern North America were patchy, dynamic, and heterogeneous. These findings challenge the view that indigenous land use was widespread and ubiquitous."
