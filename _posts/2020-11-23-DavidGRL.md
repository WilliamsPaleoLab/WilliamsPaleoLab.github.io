David Fastovich's paper [*Spatial Fingerprint of Younger Dryas Cooling and Warming in Eastern North America*](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2020GL090031) is now published in Geophysical Research Letters in an open access format. This work establishes the spatial configuration of temperature change in eastern North America during the Younger Dryas and identifies three regional temperature trends: 1) cooling in northeastern United States, 2) delayed cooling in near the Great Lakes, and 3) warming south of Virginia. The identification of warming south of Viriginia is hypothesized to be a result of atmospheric reorganization following ocean circulation changes in the North Atlantic Ocean with implications for the preservation of biodiversity over periods of abrupt climate change in Earth's past.
