biography: "I am a Masterâ€™s student developing a high-resolution palaeoecological timeline of a basin in Southeastern Wisconsin that recorded the environmental evolution of the last 27,000 years.  My short-term goal is understanding vegetation response rates to collapsing ice sheets and rapid climate change.  My long-term goal is to develop a predictability model for locating open-air occupation sites of the first peoples to inhabit the Americas via the lens of periglacial paleoenvironments.  My interests lie somewhere along the intersection of geography, archaeology, geology, biology, and GIS.  If I had spare time, I would probably be backpacking somewhere remote, at high-altitude, thinking about what the first people to see such landscapes were doing and wondering why I am not sitting by my fireplace at home with my dog and a beer.
