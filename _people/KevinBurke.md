name: "Kevin D. Burke"
biography: "I am a PhD student with the Nelson Institute for Environmental Studies interested in better understanding what future projections of climate change may mean for novel communities and land- management decisions, as well as better understanding what factors are currently driving changes in the modern pollen season. This includes extending the baseline of 'no-analogue' climate assessments to consider past-earth warm periods, as well assessing the role of climate vs. land-cover change in urban environments."
