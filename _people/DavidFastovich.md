biography: "Iâ€™m a fourth-year Ph.D. student in Physical Geography broadly interested in paleoclimates and paleoecology. My research involves using a network of fossil-pollen and organic biomarker records in eastern North America to understand the patterns and mechanisms of abrupt, millenial-scale climate change during the most recent deglaciation. I am currently comparing these records of past climate change against climate simulates to assess the role of past climate in shaping modern patterns of biodiversity."
