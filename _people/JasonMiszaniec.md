name: "Jason Miszaniec"
biography: "I am a Postdoctoral Research Associate and Museum Scientist affiliated with the Geography Department and the UW Zoological Museum. My research interests are in the long-term human and environmental interactions in Subarctic and Arctic coastal landscapes. Through the study of preserved animal remains from archaeological sites, I aim to reconstruct pre-industrial foodways and past environments. My current research employs saffron cod (*Eleginus gracilis*) ear stones (otoliths) as a proxy for reconstructing sea surface temperatures of the North Bering Sea over the last 2000 years.
