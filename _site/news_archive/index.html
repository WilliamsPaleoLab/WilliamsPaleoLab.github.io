        <h4 class='news-post-header'>Offering participant support to attend state-space modelling workshop at ESA<i class='text-muted small'> April 10, 2024</i></h4>

          <p>Dear Ecological community,</p>

<p>We are happy to announce a workshop at the Ecological Society of America, in which we will present and provide hands-on training in a new R package that uses a state-space modelling approach to test hypotheses about the environmental and abiotic factors governing species and community dynamics. The workshop will be of interest to community ecologists and paleoecologists working with community time series data and interested in drawing inferences about biotic and environment-species interactions within their multinomially distributed datasets. See workshop details below.</p>

<p>We are offering support to workshop participants on the order of $1000 to help cover travel and accommodation costs. This support is provided by the National Science Foundation. <strong>To apply, please fill in this <a href="https://forms.gle/W7t5HGYgop6cHb496">short application form</a> by April 30, 2024</strong>. We will review applications and respond by May 10, 2024. Graduate students and early career researchers will be prioritized for travel support, as will scholars from communities that are traditionally underrepresented in ecology.  We encourage applicants from all backgrounds to apply.</p>

<p>Please direct any enquiries to Quinn Asena: qasena@wisc.edu. Please note that this participant fund is only available to those intending to attend the workshop at ESA and travel awards will be made after the meeting closes.</p>

<p>Kind regards,
Quinn Asena, Tony Ives, and Jack Williams</p>

<p>Workshop details:</p>

<p><strong>Title:</strong></p>

<p>State-space methods for testing hypotheses about environmental drivers and biotic interactions in community and paleoecological time series.</p>

<p><strong>Session description:</strong></p>

<p>We will introduce a newly developed state-space modeling approach for testing hypotheses about environmental drivers and species interactions. We focus on data consisting of time-series of multinomial count data (e.g., pollen or diatom counts) when only relative, rather than absolute, information is available. Multinomial data are not appropriate for classical time-series analyses, and the resulting statistical gap has challenged efforts to formally test causal hypotheses in palaeoecological records. State-space modeling provides a rigorous framework  to test hypotheses about the environmental and abiotic factors governing past species and community dynamics. The workshop aims to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>introduce participants to state-space modelling of multinomial time series, with an emphasis on paleoecological datasets.</li>
  <li>give hands-on training, walking through examples of model fitting for estimating species-environment and species-species interactions.</li>
  <li>show how to interpret complex models.</li>
</ul>

<p>Attendees will learn how to apply the models using paleoecological data such as pollen counts. However, the modeling approach is applicable to any time-series data with a multinomial distribution. We will conduct the analyses in R, so experience using R will be useful; however, we have designed the workshop to focus on the ecological relevance and application of the model, and prior knowledge of R is not required.</p>

        <h4 class='news-post-header'>New project launched: Studying past ecological change using ancient environmental DNA<i class='text-muted small'> May 15, 2023</i></h4>

          <p>We’ve recently received funding from the UW Research Forward funding initiative to build a new team and research capacity to retrieve ancient DNA from lake sediments, as a way of studying changes in plant communities and diversity caused by climate change and human land use.  This project is in collaboration with colleagues in Botany (Ken Cameron), the Center for Limnology (Jake Vander Zanden), and the Biotechnology Center (Josh Hyman and colleagues).  Ismael Espinoza is the lead PhD student working on this project.  We’ve collected short cores from a first set of lakes this summer, and will be conducting first analyses designed to test methods and assess the ability of aeDNA to detect changes in plant communities associated with EuroAmerican Settlement and land clearance.</p>

        <h4 class='news-post-header'>New paper: Range Mapper: interactive, animated web maps of Late-Quaternary open paleoecological data<i class='text-muted small'> April 21, 2023</i></h4>

          <p>We’re excited to announce the release of <a href="https://geography.wisc.edu/rangemapper/">Range Mapper</a>, a new set of online interactive and animated maps of tree, shrub, and grass distributions and their changes in North America, Europe, and Oceania since the peak of the last Ice Age. The accompanying paper by Adrian George et al, <em>Range Mapper: An adaptable process for making and using interactive, animated web maps of Late-Quaternary open paleoecological data</em>, is published in <a href="https://openquaternary.com/articles/10.5334/oq.114">Open Quaternary</a>. These animated maps illustrate the dynamic changes in species’ ranges in response to past climate and other environmental changes. They can be readily used by educators and students interested in learning about the effects of climate change and ecosystems. Experts may also find these maps useful for quick-look insights into past patterns and processes at broad scales.  Each map is based upon networks of fossil pollen data drawn from the Neotoma Paleoecology Database. All underlying code is posted to <a href="https://github.com/NeotomaDB/RangeMapper/releases/tag/v1.0">Github</a> and <a href="https://zenodo.org/record/7600912">Zenodo</a> and can be readily adapted by other interested users to show other species or taxonomic groups of interest. Range Mapper was developed by Adrian George and Sydney Widell, with advice from Rob Roth and Jack Williams and support from the National Science Foundation (NSF).

        <h4 class='news-post-header'>New paper: Diverse responses of vegetation and fire after Pleistocene megaherbivore extinction across the eastern US<i class='text-muted small'> September 28, 2022</i></h4>

          <p>Angie Perrotti’s paper <a href="https://authors.elsevier.com/a/1fnke-4PS2FrA"><em>Diverse responses of vegetation and fire after pleistocene megaherbivore extinction across the eastern US</em></a> is now published in Quaternary Science Reviews. Alongside collaborators, Angie tested the hypothesis that end-Pleistocene megaherbivore extinction caused a cascade of changes including an incursion of woody vegetation, no-analog vegetation assemblages, and fire activity increase in eastern North America. Using the largest-to-date network of dung fungal spores, pollen, and macrocharcoal proxy records, this research found that ecosystems in the northern US are more sensitive to megaherbivory than those in the southeastern US.</p>

          <p>Congratulations to Sam Wiles for defending their Masters Thesis!  Sam’s thesis presented a new pollen record from beautiful Sunrise Lake, Michigan. They then combined this new record with 20 additional records from the Neotoma Paleoecology Database to reconstruct the past shifts of the Michigan Tension Zone (MTZ) over the last 10,000 years. Their work also tested the hypothesis that communities close to the MTZ were more sensitive to environmental change than communities far from the MTZ.</p>

        <h4 class='news-post-header'>New Science paper: Global acceleration in rates of vegetation change<i class='text-muted small'> April 05, 2021</i></h4>

          <p><a href="https://science.sciencemag.org/content/372/6544/860.full"><em>Global acceleration in rates of vegetation change over the past 18,000 years</em></a> is now published in Science.  This paper was led by Ondrej Mottl and Suzette Flantua of the HOPE team at Bergen and with senior authors Alistair Seddon (HOPE) and Jack Williams (UW-Madison).  This paper draws upon fossil pollen records from the <a href="https://www.neotomadb.org/">Neotoma Paleoecology Database</a> to demonstrate that rates of vegetation change globally are now as fast or faster as those accompanying the end of the last ice age.  This is remarkable, given the widespread transformations in global ecosystems associated with the end of the last ice age.  The recent changes, which began 3 to 4 thousand years ago, likely are due at least in part to human activity, but more work is needed to better attribute the causes of past vegetation change.  Lots of good media write-ups about this story, including pieces in <a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/environment/article/humans-have-stressed-out-earth-far-longer-and-more-dramatically-than-realized"><em>National Geographic</em></a>, <a href="https://science.sciencemag.org/content/372/6544/786"><em>Science</em></a>, <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-01336-w"><em>Nature</em></a>, <a href="https://madison.com/wsj/news/local/environment/study-humans-have-been-changing-the-planet-for-longer-than-we-thought/article_21ef3a47-b6bf-5c64-939f-f01cfa33e8fd.html#tracking-source=home-top-story-1"><em>Wisconsin State Journal</em></a>, and <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/discoveries/disc_summ.jsp?cntn_id=302872&amp;org=NSF&amp;from=news"><em>NSF</em></a>.

          <p>David Fastovich’s paper <a href="https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2020GL090031"><em>Spatial Fingerprint of Younger Dryas Cooling and Warming in Eastern North America</em></a> is now published in Geophysical Research Letters in an open access format. This work establishes the spatial configuration of temperature change in eastern North America during the Younger Dryas and identifies three regional temperature trends: 1) cooling in northeastern United States, 2) delayed cooling in near the Great Lakes, and 3) warming south of Virginia. The identification of warming south of Viriginia is hypothesized to be a result of atmospheric reorganization following ocean circulation changes in the North Atlantic Ocean with implications for the preservation of biodiversity over periods of abrupt climate change in Earth’s past.</p>

        <h4 class='news-post-header'>New paper:  More than one way to kill a spruce forest<i class='text-muted small'> October 11, 2020</i></h4>

          <p>Allie Jensen’s paper <a href="https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1365-2745.13517"><em>More than one way to kill a spruce forest: The role of fire and climate in the late‐glacial termination of spruce woodlands across the southern Great Lakes</em></a> is now published in early access format in the Journal of Ecology.  This work tests hypotheses about the role of rising temperatures and altered fire regimes as drivers of the widespread loss of spruce forests and woodlands across the central and eastern US at the end of the last glacial period.  This widespread loss of a major vegetation type is a potential analog for the possible loss of coniferous forests in the western US today with continued warming.  Great job Allie!</p>

        <h4 class='news-post-header'>Congratulations to David Fastovich: First paper!<i class='text-muted small'> March 18, 2020</i></h4>

          <p>David’s first paper, just published in <a href="https://authors.elsevier.com/c/1alc4-4PRtymX">QSR</a>, presents a new record of temperature and vegetation history in the southern Great Lakes region at the end of the last Ice Age.  The paper finds that the plant communities with no modern analog formed soon after temperatures began to rise, suggesting that warmer climates likely were a contributing factor.  Other factors, such as high temperature seasonality and the declines of megafaunal megaherbivores, remain in the mix!  David’s paper is also notable as one of the first in the region to use the brGDGT biomarkers as a signal of past temperatures, for finding that temperature variations were not as pronounced as reported in <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.quascirev.2017.12.011">Watson et al. (2018)</a>, and for a careful analysis of uncertainties in brGDGT-based temperature reconstructions.  Well done David; the first of many!</p>

          <p>Congratulations to Megs Seeley for acceptance of her first paper, to the Journal of Biogeography!  In this paper, which was developed as Megs’ undergraduate honors thesis, we assess the role of environmental filtering and dispersal limitation on American Beech (<em>Fagus grandifolia</em>) populations in Michigan and Wisconsin, using historical data from the Public Land Survey and a mixture of species distribution models.  Nice work and a good launch as Megs applies for grad school after a year working as an intern with NASA on air quality and remote sensing.</p>

        <h4 class='news-post-header'>National Parks and Climate Change<i class='text-muted small'> September 24, 2018</i></h4>

          <p>In a new paper in <a href="http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/aade09/meta">Environmental Research Letters</a>, we show that the US National Park System has experienced about twice the warming as the rest of US over the past century, and more drying too.  Even under lower-emission future scenarios (i.e. RCP2.6), 58% of the US National Park System is projected to experience a 2C warming over the coming century, but switching from high-emission to low-emission scenarios would reduce the projected temperature increases by one-half to two-thirds.

This work was led by former postdoc Alejandro Ordonez, with Jack Williams and colleagues Volker Radeloff and Sebastian Martinuzzi in CALS/Forest Ecology &amp; Wildlife. The study reports that overall, speeds of climate change are higher than land use change, with the upper Midwest and eastern Great Plains as an area of expected to experience high combined climate and land use change.
