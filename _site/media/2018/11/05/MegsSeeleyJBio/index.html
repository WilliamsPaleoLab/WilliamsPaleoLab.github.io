    <p>Congratulations to Megs Seeley for acceptance of her first paper, to the Journal of Biogeography!  In this paper, which was developed as Megsâ€™ undergraduate honors thesis, we assess the role of environmental filtering and dispersal limitation on American Beech (<em>Fagus grandifolia</em>) populations in Michigan and Wisconsin, using historical data from the Public Land Survey and a mixture of species distribution models.  Nice work and a good launch as Megs applies for grad school after a year working as an intern with NASA on air quality and remote sensing.</p>
