    <p>A new study published in Nature Climate Change calculates the combined velocities of future climate and land use change in the coterminous US. This work was led by former postdoc Alejandro Ordonez, with Jack Williams and colleagues Volker Radeloff and Sebastian Martinuzzi in CALS/Forest Ecology &amp; Wildlife. The study reports that overall, speeds of climate change are higher than land use change, with the upper Midwest and eastern Great Plains as an area of expected to experience high combined climate and land use change. The projected rates of climate change are similar to or higher than the dispersal capacity of many species. <a href="http://www.nature.com/nclimate/journal/v4/n9/full/nclimate2337.html">Article</a>, <a href="http://news.wisc.edu/no-one-size-fits-all-approach-in-a-changing-climate-changing-land/">UW Press Release</a>, <a href="http://www.eenews.net/climatewire/2014/08/20/stories/1060004701">ClimateWire</a></p>
