    <p>Simon Goring has a new paper <em>“Effect of historical land-use and climate change on tree-climate relationships in the upper Midwestern United States”</em> in <a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/ele.12747/full">Ecology Letters</a> that demonstrates that tree-climate niches have shifted over the past several centuries as a result of land use and climate change, and assesses their relative importance.  Congrats Simon!</p>
