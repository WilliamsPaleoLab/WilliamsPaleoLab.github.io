    <p>Yue Wang has  published a new paper <em>“The southern coastal Beringian land bridge: cryptic refugium or pseudorefugium for woody plants during the Last Glacial Maximum?”</em> in <a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jbi.13010/full">Journal of Biogeography</a>.  This paper presents strong evidence that the southern coastal Bering Land Bridge was not a refugium for woody plants during the last glacial maximum, and that the St. Paul mammoth populations persisted on an open tundra vegetation for thousands of years.</p>
