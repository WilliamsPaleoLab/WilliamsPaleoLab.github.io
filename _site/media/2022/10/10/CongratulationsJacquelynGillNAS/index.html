    <p>We always knew that Dr. Jacquelyn Gill (lab alumna, PhD 2012) was an outstanding science communicator, but now it’s official: she’s one of the best in the country!  The National Academy of Sciences has just awarded Jacquelyn an <a href="https://www.nationalacademies.org/awards/excellence-in-communication/winners/jacquelyn-gill">Eric and Wendy Schmidt Award for Excellence in Science Communication</a>.  This honor is so well-deserved: from the start, Jacquelyn has always been passionate about science communications and always ready to try creative new ways of reaching audiences - whether it be live-streaming her dissertation (way back before this was a thing), social media, podcasts <a href="https://warmregardspodcast.com/">Warm Regards</a>, or <a href="https://www.thesunmagazine.org/issues/561/grief-almanac-for-an-apocalypse">heartfelt essays</a>.  Jacquelyn brings her full self to her science and her science communications, and her fierce authenticity has made her a role model to so many.  Thank you, Jacquelyn, for your tireless efforts to fight misinformation and share knowledge.</p>
