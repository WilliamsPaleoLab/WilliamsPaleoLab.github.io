    <p>Congratulations to Sam Wiles for defending their Masters Thesis!  Samâ€™s thesis presented a new pollen record from beautiful Sunrise Lake, Michigan. They then combined this new record with 20 additional records from the Neotoma Paleoecology Database to reconstruct the past shifts of the Michigan Tension Zone (MTZ) over the last 10,000 years. Their work also tested the hypothesis that communities close to the MTZ were more sensitive to environmental change than communities far from the MTZ.</p>
