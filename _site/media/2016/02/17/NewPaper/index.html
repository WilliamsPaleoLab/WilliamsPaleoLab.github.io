    <p>Lab member Yue Wang has a <a href="http://hol.sagepub.com/content/early/2015/12/07/0959683615612586">new paper</a> out in the Holocene detailing regional changes in beech (<em>Fagus grandifolia</em>) abundance in the Great Lakes region during the Holocene.  Using Bayesian methods she shows that the changing fortunes of beech are similar to those recorded for hemlock during the Holocene and appear to be tied to drought events recorded in the region, but the lack of spatially continuous records and paleoclimate proxy data in the region means that a direct link remains elusive.</p>
