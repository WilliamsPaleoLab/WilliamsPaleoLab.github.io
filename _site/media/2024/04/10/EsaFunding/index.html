    <p>Dear Ecological community,</p>

<p>We are happy to announce a workshop at the Ecological Society of America, in which we will present and provide hands-on training in a new R package that uses a state-space modelling approach to test hypotheses about the environmental and abiotic factors governing species and community dynamics. The workshop will be of interest to community ecologists and paleoecologists working with community time series data and interested in drawing inferences about biotic and environment-species interactions within their multinomially distributed datasets. See workshop details below.</p>

<p>We are offering support to workshop participants on the order of $1000 to help cover travel and accommodation costs. This support is provided by the National Science Foundation. <strong>To apply, please fill in this <a href="https://forms.gle/W7t5HGYgop6cHb496">short application form</a> by April 30, 2024</strong>. We will review applications and respond by May 10, 2024. Graduate students and early career researchers will be prioritized for travel support, as will scholars from communities that are traditionally underrepresented in ecology.  We encourage applicants from all backgrounds to apply.</p>

<p>Please direct any enquiries to Quinn Asena: qasena@wisc.edu. Please note that this participant fund is only available to those intending to attend the workshop at ESA and travel awards will be made after the meeting closes.</p>

<p>Kind regards,
Quinn Asena, Tony Ives, and Jack Williams</p>

<p>Workshop details:</p>

<p><strong>Title:</strong></p>

<p>State-space methods for testing hypotheses about environmental drivers and biotic interactions in community and paleoecological time series.</p>

<p><strong>Session description:</strong></p>

<p>We will introduce a newly developed state-space modeling approach for testing hypotheses about environmental drivers and species interactions. We focus on data consisting of time-series of multinomial count data (e.g., pollen or diatom counts) when only relative, rather than absolute, information is available. Multinomial data are not appropriate for classical time-series analyses, and the resulting statistical gap has challenged efforts to formally test causal hypotheses in palaeoecological records. State-space modeling provides a rigorous framework  to test hypotheses about the environmental and abiotic factors governing past species and community dynamics. The workshop aims to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>introduce participants to state-space modelling of multinomial time series, with an emphasis on paleoecological datasets.</li>
  <li>give hands-on training, walking through examples of model fitting for estimating species-environment and species-species interactions.</li>
  <li>show how to interpret complex models.</li>
</ul>

<p>Attendees will learn how to apply the models using paleoecological data such as pollen counts. However, the modeling approach is applicable to any time-series data with a multinomial distribution. We will conduct the analyses in R, so experience using R will be useful; however, we have designed the workshop to focus on the ecological relevance and application of the model, and prior knowledge of R is not required.</p>
