    <p>All good things come to an end, and this includes David Fastovich’s time as a PhD student in a Williams Lab!  David has successfully defended his PhD dissertation “<em>Patterns, mechanisms, and legacies of abrupt climate change: examining the Younger Dryas in eastern North America</em>.”  David did a superlative job diving deep into a broad range of paleoclimatic proxies and paleoclimatic simulations from Earth system models, all to understand the patterns and drivers of millennial-scale climate variability in eastern North America.  He’s got papers published in Geophysical Research Letters and Quaternary Science Reviews and more on the way.  David’s now started a postdoc with the fantastic Dr. Tripti Bhattacharya at Syracuse.  If you’d like to connect with David, his new contact info and personal webpage is <a href="https://davidfastovich.com/">here</a>.  Congratulations and best wishes for this next stage of David’s life and career.</p>
