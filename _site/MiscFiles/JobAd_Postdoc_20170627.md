# Job Opening: Post-Doctoral Research Associate: Paleovegetation Reconstruction
The Williams Paleovegetation Lab at the University of Wisconsin-Madisonâ€™s Department of Geography seeks an exceptional Post-Doctoral Research Associate with expertise in paleoecology and quantitative methods.  The applicant will join the Paleoecological Observatory Network (PalEON) and its efforts to build rigorous estimates of past vegetation composition and structure for the past millennia.  The applicant will also contribute to LandCover6k efforts to reconstruct land cover for the Northern Hemisphere during the early Anthropocene.  

Initial activities will focus on developing and comparing reconstructions of vegetation for the last several millennia based on the state-of-the art pollen-vegetation models STEPPS and REVEALS for target regions in North America.  Next stages will move towards developing new methods for vegetation reconstruction.  The applicant also will have time set aside to carry forward their own research from prior projects.  The applicant will work closely with other PalEON and LandCover6k collaborators, including colleagues at Mount Royal, Notre Dame, Boston University, UC-Berkeley, Arizona, and Ottawa.  

Ideal qualifications include the following, while recognizing that not all candidates will be equally strong in all areas:
* Enthusiasm and ability to work collaboratively
* Familiarity with Bayesian statistics OR quantitatively inclined and willing to learn. Other desirable areas of expertise include pollen-vegetation modeling, transfer functions, or related approaches
* Programming experience with R, GitHub, or similar scientific languages and code-sharing systems
* A background in paleoecology, paleoclimatology, vegetation ecology, or related field
* PhD at the time of hiring.

Applications will be reviewed immediately upon submission. Preference is for a start date during Summer 2017 or as soon as possible thereafter. Initial appointment will be for 12 months, with potential for continuation to 24 months, depending upon funding and performance. Salary for this full-time position will be $48,000 per year, plus health insurance benefits.  The Williams Lab and UW-Madison are committed to improving the diversity of science; candidates of all backgrounds are invited to apply.

Madison is widely recognized for its warm community, high quality of life, and easy access to natural areas.  Costs of living are moderate, and public transportation and bicycle paths are easy transportation options. There is a thriving international community.

To apply, please submit an electronic cover letter detailing qualifications, CV, and phone and email addresses of three references by **July 12** to Jack Williams jww@geography.wisc.edu.
